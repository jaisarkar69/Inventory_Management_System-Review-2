# Inventory_Management_System-Review-2
A Java-based console application that allows users to manage personal inventory. Features include secure login, item tracking (add, update, delete), search and sort functions, receipt generation in HTML format, and data persistence using text files.

# Inventory Management System

## Project Description

This Inventory Management System is a console-based Java application designed to help users efficiently manage their personal inventory items. The application provides a simple interface where users can register and log in securely. Once logged in, users can add new items, view existing items, update item details, and delete items from their inventory.

The project aims to demonstrate core programming concepts such as file handling, user authentication, data validation, and modular coding. Additionally, the system can generate an HTML receipt summarizing the inventory, which can be saved or printed for records.

This project helps students practice problem-solving, coding best practices, and project documentation.

## Features

- **User Registration and Login:** Secure registration with password strength validation and login functionality.
- **Add Inventory Items:** Users can add details like item name, quantity, and price.
- **View Inventory:** List all items with their details in a user-friendly format.
- **Update Items:** Modify existing item details as needed.
